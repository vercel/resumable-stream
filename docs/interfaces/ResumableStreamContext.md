# Interface: ResumableStreamContext

## Properties

### createNewResumableStream()

> **createNewResumableStream**: (`streamId`, `makeStream`, `skipCharacters?`) => `Promise`\<`null` \| `ReadableStream`\<`string`\>\>

Creates a new resumable stream.

#### Parameters

##### streamId

`string`

The ID of the stream. Must be unique for each stream.

##### makeStream

() => `ReadableStream`\<`string`\>

A function that returns a stream of strings. It's only executed if the stream it not yet in progress.

##### skipCharacters?

`number`

Number of characters to skip

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`null` \| `ReadableStream`\<`string`\>\>

A readable stream of strings. Returns null if there was a stream with the given streamId but it is already fully done (Defaults to 24 hour expiration)

***

### hasExistingStream()

> **hasExistingStream**: (`streamId`) => `Promise`\<`null` \| `true` \| `"DONE"`\>

Checks if a stream with the given streamId exists.

#### Parameters

##### streamId

`string`

The ID of the stream.

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`null` \| `true` \| `"DONE"`\>

null if there is no stream with the given streamId. True if a stream with the given streamId exists. "DONE" if the stream is fully done.

***

### resumableStream()

> **resumableStream**: (`streamId`, `makeStream`, `skipCharacters?`) => `Promise`\<`null` \| `ReadableStream`\<`string`\>\>

Creates or resumes a resumable stream.

Throws if the underlying stream is already done. Instead save the complete output to a database and read from that
after streaming completed.

By default returns the entire buffered stream. Use `skipCharacters` to resume from a specific point.

#### Parameters

##### streamId

`string`

The ID of the stream. Must be unique for each stream.

##### makeStream

() => `ReadableStream`\<`string`\>

A function that returns a stream of strings. It's only executed if the stream it not yet in progress.

##### skipCharacters?

`number`

Number of characters to skip

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`null` \| `ReadableStream`\<`string`\>\>

A readable stream of strings. Returns null if there was a stream with the given streamId but it is already fully done (Defaults to 24 hour expiration)

***

### resumeExistingStream()

> **resumeExistingStream**: (`streamId`, `skipCharacters?`) => `Promise`\<`undefined` \| `null` \| `ReadableStream`\<`string`\>\>

Resumes a stream that was previously created by `createNewResumableStream`.

#### Parameters

##### streamId

`string`

The ID of the stream. Must be unique for each stream.

##### skipCharacters?

`number`

Number of characters to skip

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`undefined` \| `null` \| `ReadableStream`\<`string`\>\>

A readable stream of strings. Returns null if there was a stream with the given streamId but it is already fully done (Defaults to 24 hour expiration). undefined if there is no stream with the given streamId.
